# beschdIRCd #
or "best IRC daemon" if you want to.

beschdIRCd is a project by me a german student who doesn't like any irc server out there.
So I decided to write another one. As I'm German I want to use some things from german language. So "beschd" is just another form of english "best" but .. well it has a sarcastic background.

## Why this!? ##
Because I can.

## Requirements ##
This project will require

* Windows Vista+ (Windows Server 2k8)
* .NET Framework 4.5
* SqlCe 4.0 (or if you want SqlServer, or anything which has Entity Framework Support)
* Internet.

## License ##
.. is to be decided.
Will look out for one.

## Contribution ##
You may contribute so I can get forward in development but you're not forced to.
It's for me to get some distance to other projects I'm actively working on. Don't expect fast development.

## End ##
Thath's it. If I can write more .. I'll do.
